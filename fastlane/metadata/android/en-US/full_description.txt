<p><i>QZ Companion Nordictrack Treadmill</i> is a companion app of QZ for Nordictrack Treadmills that works on iFit-enabled/iFit-embedded treadmills. It transmits speed and inclination directly to Zwift. Also, auto-inclination and speed control works on some models of NordicTrack and ProForm treadmills.</p><p>The QZ Companion app, when installed on your treadmill, communicates live speed and inclination to the QZ app running on another device (e.g. Windows PC or laptop, Android phone or tablet, or iOS iPhone or iPad). QZ then communicates this information to Zwift running on a 3rd device (e.g. Windows PC or laptop, Android phone or tablet, or iOS iPhone or iPad). A second device could be used to run both QZ and Zwift, eliminating the need for a third device, as long as QZ runs in the background while Zwift runs in the foreground.</p><p>The matching app for your smartphone/tablet can be <a href='https://github.com/cagnulein/qdomyos-zwift' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>found here</a>.</p>
